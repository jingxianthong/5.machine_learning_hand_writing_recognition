Ah, that's the key piece of information! The error message now clarifies that running scripts is disabled on your system's PowerShell execution policy. This security setting prevents potentially malicious scripts from running.

There are two ways to address this, but it's important to choose the approach that balances security with your needs:

**Option 1: Temporarily Allow Script Execution (Less Secure)**

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:** Right-click on the Windows PowerShell icon and select "Run as administrator."
2. **Set Execution Policy (Temporary):** Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This temporarily allows script execution for the current user session only. Once you close the PowerShell window, the policy will revert back to its previous setting.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Now that script execution is allowed, run the activation script again:

   ```powershell
   .\Scripts\activate.ps1
   ```

This will hopefully activate your virtual environment. However, keep in mind that this approach is less secure as it allows any script to run in your current session.

**Option 2: Allow Remote Signed Scripts (More Secure)**

1. **Change Execution Policy (Persistent):** Open PowerShell as administrator (same as in Option 1) and type the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   This allows scripts signed by a trusted publisher to run, while still restricting unsigned scripts. You might need to restart PowerShell after this change.

2. **Verify Script Signature (Optional):** While not always the case, virtual environment activation scripts are sometimes signed. You can check the script's signature by right-clicking on `.\Scripts\activate.ps1` and selecting "Properties." Look for a "Digital Signatures" tab.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** If the script is signed, you can now activate the virtual environment without further issues:

   ```powershell
   .\Scripts\activate.ps1
   ```

**Recommendation:**

- If security is not a major concern in your development environment, Option 1 might be quicker. However, for a more secure setup, consider Option 2.
- Remember that changing the execution policy should be done cautiously, especially on production machines.

Once your virtual environment is activated, you should see the virtual environment name prefixed to your command prompt (e.g., `.venv`). You can then proceed to install `scikit-learn` and run your Python script.
