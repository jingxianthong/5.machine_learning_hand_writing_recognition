# Machine Learning Number Recognition

This repository contains code for a machine learning project that recognizes handwritten numbers. The project is inspired by Teimur Gasanov's work, but it includes modifications to improve recognition accuracy and stability.

## Overview

The original code, `Machine_learning_file.py`, was adapted from [Teimur Gasanov's article](https://www.toptal.com/data-science/machine-learning-number-recognition) on number recognition using machine learning. While the code provides a functional baseline, it was observed that the recognition output could be inconsistent. For example, drawing the number "2" could sometimes be recognized as "7", "5", "8", or "9".

### Chnage have maked

To address this instability, a second file, `Mechines_learning_image-recogion-testing.py`, was created to perform additional testing and evaluation. This file allows for testing a list of numbers in various formats to find out the which format this machine could not recogion.

### Key Features

- **Original Code (`Machine_learning_file.py`)**: Implements the baseline number recognition model.
- **Modified Code (`modified_recognition.py`)**: Refines the model by testing it on a diverse set of number images.
- **`number_image/` Folder**: Contains images of numbers in different formats used for testing.

## Result
Numbers with mulpitle coulour and numbers with werid form also cannot to be recogion.

## improvements 

recent studying the mechine learning. So comming sooonn.
